# Front-end Web Development class materials

This is a repository of class materials I have created for the lectures and labs of my
[Front-end Web Development](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Front-end_Web_Development) class.

## How to use this repository

Often in class, I will ask that you download this repository and use some files located in
specific folders to be able to follow along with my lecture. The best way to use this repository
is to clone it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/JeffreyATW/fwd.git
```

Once you clone it, I would recommend not making any changes to the repository. This includes
forking it and maintaining a parallel copy. If you want to do your own work, I recommend keeping
a folder entirely outside of this repository and creating one folder per each class there. This
is because it will be harder to reconcile further updates to this repository if your changes get
in the way of mine.

To update this repository to the latest version, `cd` into the `fwd` folder and run:

```shell
git pull
```

If this command somehow fails or says that there are conflicts, I would recommend deleting the
`fwd` folder and starting over by cloning the repository again.
